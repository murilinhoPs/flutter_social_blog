# flutter_social_blog

A Flutter project simulating a blogging app to share ideas and thoughts. It's a basic app that I used twitter as base and added my custom "flavors", another navigation method  and I used halloween colors palletes.

## In this project

1. I used Getx as the core of the application for dependency, routes and state management
2. Divide the app into global folder, to use in the entirely application and divided into modules
3. Inside every modules are the controllers and the dependencies it will use, is inside modules folder
4. I'm testing how to use navigation rails globally, so might some navigation bugs
5. [All screenshots](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1q431utHZhuIxPOy3M26JxTUMPIcidxem?usp=sharing)
6. The build is in the dist folder, it's an apk
7. Thanks!

### Back-end
I made the rest api that I'm consuming in the app. I added authentication with JWT and refresh tokens, added postgreesql in heroku with users_tables, image for profile image and posts table. I made using nodeJs with typescript, here is the repository: https://github.com/murilinhoPs/auth_back_ts.

1. There some things I need to fix in the back-end, like the profile images that disapear from the api after some time, because heroku sleeps and clean the folder. I'm going to put the images in the google cloud.
2. Might be another error or another, but feel free to take a look. Thanks!

### Bugs

1. If this occurs, just pull the page to refresh or go to other page and back to this page.
